The following are the list activities you can use in your microflow:

* [Call REST Service](call-rest-action) – calls a REST endpoint
* [Call Web Service](call-web-service-action) – calls an imported web service operation
* [Import Mapping](import-mapping-action) – imports data from an XML or JSON document into objects
* [Export Mapping](export-mapping-action) – exports data from objects into XML or JSON documents, or a string variable

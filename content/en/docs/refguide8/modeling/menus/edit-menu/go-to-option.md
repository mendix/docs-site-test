## 1 Introduction

In Studio Pro editors, such as navigation, page, or microflow editor, you can access a handy menu by right-clicking items. A **Go to** option is commonly used to find your way in a project. It allows you to navigate from one element to another: for example, to navigate to the target of a button or to the source of a data grid.

## 2 Go To Option

The examples of using the **Go to** option are described below:

* **Opening a target of a menu item** – in **Project** > **Navigation**, you can right-click a menu item and select **Go to target**. Studio Pro will open the corresponding target of the menu item,for example, a page.

* **Opening a data source of an element** – on pages, you can navigate to the data source of a widget. For example, you can right-click a button in the data grid and select **Go to microflow**. Mendix Studio Pro will open the corresponding microflow:

* **Opening an entity from a microflow** – you can navigate to an entity in the domain model if you right-click an activity in the microflow and select **Go to entity**. Mendix Studio Pro will open the corresponding domain model:
